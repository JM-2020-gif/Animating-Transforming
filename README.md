# Animating-Transforming
In this school project HTML & CSS - Animating & Transforming.
CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animationâ€™s style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
This is a demonstration using some simple animations.
